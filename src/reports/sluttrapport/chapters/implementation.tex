\chapter{Phases}
During the development of the project, we decided to work in sprints, each lasting approximately two weeks, as discussed in \hyperref[devmethod]{\ref{devmethod} Development method}. However, it is apparent, in retrospective that our process can be divided into four phases:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{lcll}
		Phase 1 & - & Planning and research phase & week (1-4) \\
		Phase 2& - & Rest API and why it did not work with our project& week (5-8) \\
		Phase 3 & - & Websocket with SignalR & week (9-12) \\
		Phase 4 & - & Demonstration of our system & week (13-18) 
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

An overview of our sprints are in figure A.1
