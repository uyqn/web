\chapter{Phases}
Our sprints each lasted two weeks, as per described in section \ref{scrumsprint}, but in retrospect, it is apparent that we can divide our process into four phases:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{lcll}
		Phase 1 & - & Planning and research phase & week (1-4) \\
		Phase 2& - & Rest API and why it did not work with our project& week (5-8) \\
		Phase 3 & - & Websocket with SignalR & week (9-12) \\
		Phase 4 & - & Demonstration of our system & week (13-18) 
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
