\section{Self driving cars}
Autonomous vehicles also known as self-driving cars are becoming more and more relevant. We see huge companies such as Tesla and Ruter investing into research. Ruter has implemented a short route that is part of Ruter’s transport system where there are only self driving buses. Even though it’s unclear exactly when fully automated vehicles will hit the roads it seems like the day is getting closer and closer. It’s impossible to predict exactly what's going to occur in a traffic scenario. That’s why the use of AI is prefered compared to traditional computing in this setting. 

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) currently defines 6 levels of driving automation ranging from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous) \parencite{synopsys_autonomous_car}. The self driving buses Ruter has implemented is at the third level of automation. This means that there is a driver present to take over if something goes wrong. In this project we will mainly focus on the 4th level of automation. In the fourth level of automatization there is no driver present and the car is fully automated in a specific setting, in our case, a prebuilt track. What differentiate the fourth and the fifth level is that in the fifth level the vehicles can drive in any setting.
