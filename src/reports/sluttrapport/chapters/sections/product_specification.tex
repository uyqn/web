\section{Essential code snippets behind the system}
The main part of this project is to develop a client-server communication system, with the purpose of producing a physical simulation on how a centralized system can contribute to an improved traffic flow. Due to the nature of this project, no graphical user interfaces has been developed. Hence, it is deemed necessary to present key parts of the code that are responsible for such a system to work. This section will therefore elaborate, in detail, how essential code snippets are interacting with each to produce the result.

Furthermore, the code that has been written during this project has been written in the languages Python and C\# using Pycharm and Rider IDE respectively. Therefore, syntax highlighting has also been used to best simulate the same syntax highlighting used in both IDE respectively. In addition, some artistic freedom has been used to present the code snippets; the symbol \verb|...| has been used to indicate irrelevant code to the current discussion and the symbol  \textcolor{red}{$\hookrightarrow$} simply means that the line of code following \textcolor{red}{$\hookrightarrow$} is on the same line above but is broken up due to lack of space. Also, each code snippets starts with the class and method it belongs to.
