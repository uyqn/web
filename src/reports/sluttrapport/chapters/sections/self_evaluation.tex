\subsection{Self evaluation}
As mentioned earlier in \secref{sec:dev_method}, we used inspiration from two agile frameworks: Scrum and Kanban, but chose to lean more towards scrum in the end. The use of Scrum helped us reach our goals. However, we could have included our external supervisors more in the Scrum process in hindsight. We could have done this by including them in sprint retrospective meetings and discussing what our following sprint goals should have been together.

The IoT system can handle more vehicles, but the road model does not fully support functionalities for having more roads than we currently have in our demonstration. Because of the time constraint, we also found it challenging to focus on scalability. Hence, we instead focused on getting a working demonstration.  

One challenge was that our group could not meet as much as we had wished because of work. However, all the requirements in the MosCoW analysis (\figref{fig:moscowmethod}) were reached except for the features in the "can have" section. All in all, the group was satisfied with the process.
