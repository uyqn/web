\section{Results}

We observed troughout multible demonstrations that the vehicles accelerated from 80 cm/s to 55 cm/s when the server intervnted. Without the servers intervention, one of the vehicles would have had to completely stop at the intersection which would be a higher change in velocity. We concluded with that in this specific scenario, the server had increased traffic flow. However it is hard to say anyhting regarding more complex scenarios with more vehicles.
