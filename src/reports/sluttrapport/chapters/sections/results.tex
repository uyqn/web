\section{Results}
After finishing the fourth development phase we showed the video snippets we had filmed to our supervisors and the product owner, in addition to giving an in-depth explanation of the outcomes the demonstration showed. They seemed pleased with the product, and the feedback we got was positive. The product owner confirmed that our results adhered to the requriements set.

The summary of the results from the process was:

A server where multible vehicles can communicate with eachother. The server functions to increase traffic flow, and has responsibility for calculations and decision making. 

A client, in our case the two cars which are able to send information to a server. Theese cars can drive both when connected to the server or not.

A semi physical demonstration that shows how the system works in an intersection.

A more technical description of how the appications work can be found in the product documentation.
