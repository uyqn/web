\section{Planning and research phase}

After we had gotten in touch with Accenture and spoken with the supervisors and the product owner, the group had to make a few decisions regarding the direction of the project.

The first choice to make was to either build an AI for the vehicles from scratch or use the AI from the group prior. Building the AI from scratch ment that we could make an AI which integrated our system from the start, however with the time constraint of the project we decided that it would take less time to use the product from the group prior. In addition, our group had more prior experience with networking than with raspberry Pi and AI. We therefore chose to use the AI from the project prior. We also had to decide which technologies and programming languages to use.

In this phase we did not have access to the vehicle made by the prior bachelor group and neither the code. In addition there was a need for project planning and research before we could start developing our IoT-system. The topics needed to be researched was:

\begin{itemize}
\item Research what causes traffic jams and solutions to fix it.
\item Research IoT-systems and how they function with vehicles.
\item Research different planning methods that will fit our project
\end{itemize}
We also used the pre-project phase to get to know Accenture, their guidelines and their workspace since we were going to work a their office.
