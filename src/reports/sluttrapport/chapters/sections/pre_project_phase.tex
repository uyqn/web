\section{Phase 1 - Planning and research phase}

After we had gotten in touch with Accenture and spoken with the supervisors and the product owner, the group had to make a few decisions regarding the project's direction.

The first choice was to either build an AI for the vehicles from scratch or use the AI from the group prior. Building the AI from scratch meant that we could make an AI that integrated our system from the start. However, with the project's time constraint, we decided that it would take less time to use the product from the group prior to us. In addition, our group had more prior experience with networking than with raspberry Pi and AI. We, therefore, chose to use the AI from the project prior. We also had to decide which technologies and programming languages to use.

In this phase, we did not have access to the vehicle made by the prior bachelor group and neither the code. In addition, there was a need for project planning and research before we could start developing our IoT system. The topics that needed to be researched were:

\begin{itemize}
\item Research what causes traffic jams and solutions to fix it.
\item Research IoT-systems and how they function with vehicles.
\item Research different planning methods that will fit our project
\end{itemize}
We also used the pre-project phase to get to know Accenture, their guidelines, and their workspace since we would work in their office.
