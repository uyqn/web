\section{Pre-project phase}
After we had gotten in touch with Accenture and spoken with the supervisors and the product owner, the group had to make a few decisions regarding the direction of the project.

The first choice to make was to either build an AI for the vehicles from scratch or use the AI from the group prior. Building the AI from scratch ment that we could make an AI which integrated our system from the start, however with the time constraint of the project we decided that it would take less time to use the product from the group prior. In addition, the group had more prior experience with networking than with raspberry Pi and AI. We therefore chose to use the AI from the project prior. 

During the pre-project phase there was a need for some project planning. During this planning phase we made a brief project plan. The plan contained a backlog with tasks and the estimated time period we would have to work on that current task, and with that a gantt-diagram containing those tasks. 

We also used the pre-project phase to get to know Accenture, their guidelines and their workspace.
