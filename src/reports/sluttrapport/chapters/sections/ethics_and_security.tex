For an Ai to be able to train there will be a need for training data. Therefore a database saving information about the trips will be needed, in the IoT-system, for the AI to further improve.

When there is saving of data involved it is important to consider personal information. Personal information typically includes name, address, phone number, email and date of birth \parencite{datatilsynet_personopplysning}. In addition it also includes behavioral patterns, for example where you drive to work each day or where you go shopping. In this case, an IoT system that saves the car's trips itâ€™s considered saving of personal information. The system could try to anonymize the data, but there will still be possibilities to find patterns in the data. You are allowed to save some personal information as long as you follow certain rules. 

Hackers are a problem when it comes to systems controlling entities that can affect human lives. If hackers were able to get control of such a system it could lead to a lot of damage. It is therefore important for a secure security system to be in place. If anyone were to breach the system, it would have to detect that it has been breached, and shut down so the cars can move on their own without the system.
