\section{System security}
Security and privacy are important topics for any IoT-system. Because these systems gather and work with huge amounts of data, they are naturally prone to being attacked. And as the systems grow and become more interconnected, with many devices around the world, the imposed risk of such an attack increases drastically \textcolor{red}{[kilde på dette]}. Our project is on a small enough scale that we don’t expect security to be an extremely important feature for it to work. However, because we want the system to be scalable in the future we have implemented some ideas that we think improves the data security in our system.
