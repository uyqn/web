\subsection{Possible improvements}

Although we were able to forfill the product requirements there are room for improvement. All the requirements in the MoSCoW method from "could have" to "won't have this time" are requirements for a future project, either for accenture to improve or for a future bachelor project. In addition there are also improvements that can be done with the accuracy of the demo, specificly by doing more calibration tests and make a more accurate formula than we were able to produce. A more accurate demonstration can also be made by changing some of the wheels so that the vehicles can drive more straight. 

Making a product that i viable in the real world is a long way ahead. That will require a lot more testing and implementation on a bigger scale. However, we hope that our testing and research can be of value towards that step.
