\subsection{Choice of programming languages}
For the programming languages we used python for the client and C\# for the server. The group prior had used python for their raspberry Pi car. This meant that using python made it easier to extend the code from that project. The group also had prior experience with networking in python, therefore making python a prime choice of programming language for the client. C\# supports multiple ASP.NET Core libraries which was useful since we were going to work with networking.  We also had some prior knowledge coding in C\# as well.
