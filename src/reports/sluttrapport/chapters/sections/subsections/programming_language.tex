\subsection{Choice of programming languages}
We chose to use python for the client and C# for the server for the programming languages. The group prior to us had used python for their Raspberry Pi vehicle. Using python ourselves made it easier to extend the code from the project prior. Our group also had experience with networking in python, making python a prime choice of programming language for the client. C# supports multiple ASP.NET Core libraries, which was helpful since we were going to work with networking. The server needs to be as efficient as possible, and C# is considered a fast programming language. We also had some prior knowledge of coding in C#.
