\subsection{Choice of programming languages}
We chose to implement the client in python and the server in C\#. The group before us had used python for their Raspberry Pi vehicle, making python a natural choice to extend the code from their project. Our group also had experience with networking in python. Furthermore, the .NET ecosystem has well-developed solutions for creating IoT applications, microservices, and web applications (Legg til kilde her). To take advantage of these solutions we had to write our server in C\#. The server needed to be as efficient as possible, and C\# is also considered a fast programming language (kilde?). We also had some prior knowledge of coding in C\#.
