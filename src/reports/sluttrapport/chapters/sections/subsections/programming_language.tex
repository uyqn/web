\subsection{Choice of programming languages}
We chose to implement the client in Python and the server in C\#. The group before us had used Python for their Raspberry Pi vehicle, making Python a natural choice to extend the code from their project. Our group also had experience with networking in Python. Furthermore, the .NET ecosystem has well-developed solutions for creating IoT applications, microservices, and web applications \parencite{dotnet}. We had to write our server in C\#, to take advantage of these solutions. The server needed to be as efficient as possible, and C\# is also considered a fast programming language \parencite{csharp}. We also had some prior knowledge of coding in C\#.
