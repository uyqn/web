\subsection{Choice of programming languages}
For the programming languages, we chose to use python for the client and C\# for the server. The group prior had used python for their raspberry Pi vehicle. This meant that using python made it easier to extend the code from the project prior. Our group also had experience with networking in python, therefore making python a prime choice of programming language for the client. C\# supports multiple ASP.NET Core libraries which was useful since we were going to work with networking. The server needs to be as efficient as possible and C\# is considered a fast programming language. We also had some prior knowledge coding in C\# as well.
