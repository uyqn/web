\subsection{Goals and requirements}
The project aims to produce a prototype that can be shown to stakeholders and, either physically or digitally, demonstrate how Accenture could combine self-driving cars with a centralized system. We will utilize the self-driving vehicle built for Accenture from the previous bachelor thesis. Preferably, the prototype can show at least one situation where the outcome differs depending on the use of self-driving cars plus a centralized system versus only using self-driving vehicles. The system should also be scalable so that more vehicles can be added or removed at a later point in time.
