\subsection{Goals and requirements}
The goal of the project is to end up with a prototype that can be shown to interesents and demonstrate how self-driving cars could be combined with a centralized system. For this we will use the self-driving car that Accenture already owns, as a result of the previous bachelor's-thesis done with them. The conditions are that the product must be possible to present, either as a physical or digital showcase. Preferably, the prototype can show at least one situation where the outcome differs depending on the use of self-driving cars plus a centralized system, versus only using self-driving cars. The system should also be scalable, so that more vehicles can be added or removed at a later point in time.
