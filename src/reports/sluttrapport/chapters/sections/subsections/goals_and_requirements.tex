\subsection{Goals and requirements}\label{sec:goals}
The project aims to produce a prototype that can be shown to stakeholders and, either physically or digitally, demonstrate how Accenture could combine self-driving cars with a centralized system. We will utilize the self-driving vehicle built for Accenture from the previous bachelor thesis. Preferably, the prototype can show at least one situation where the outcome differs depending on self-driving cars plus a centralized system versus only using self-driving vehicles. Furthermore, the cars should also be able to drive independently with the incorporated AI model if the centralized system is out of reach. The system should also be scalable so that more vehicles can be added or removed at a later point in time.
