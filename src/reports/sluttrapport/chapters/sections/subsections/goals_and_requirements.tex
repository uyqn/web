\subsection{Goals and requirements}
The project aims to end up with a prototype that can be shown to stakeholders and demonstrate how Accenture could combine self-driving cars with a centralized system. We will use the self-driving car Accenture already owns due to the previous bachelor's thesis done with them. The conditions are that the product must be possible to present, either as a physical or digital showcase. Preferably, the prototype can show at least one situation where the outcome differs depending on the use of self-driving cars plus a centralized system versus only using self-driving vehicles. The system should also be scalable so that more vehicles can be added or removed at a later point in time.
