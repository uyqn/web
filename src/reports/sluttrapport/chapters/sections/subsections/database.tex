\subsection{VehiclesHubDatabase}
The \verb|VehiclesHubDatabase| played a key role in this project. Coming to the realization on \hyperref[phase3]{\ref{phase3} Phase 3 - Signal R} the project needed a database that could handle the continuous changes in each \verb|Vehicle| position in real time. During research the group was unable to conclude on any databases that would fit our requirement. Hence, \verb|VehiclesHubDatanbase| was created to serve as a live in-memory database that could continuously update the positions of each vehicle on each lane.
