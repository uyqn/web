\subsection{Patch}
After initialization and handshake elaborated in \secref{initialization} and \secref{handshake} respectively, the Raspberry Pi vehicles start to drive into an intersection simultaneously. Throughout the journey, the cars are continuously patching to the server by calling the client's \verb|async def send\_patch| method.

\begin{python}
class Client:
	...
	async def send_patch(self, **kwargs) -> None:
		if self.properties_has_changed(**kwargs) or self.__continuously_patch:
			await self.send_invocation("patch", self.properties)
		else:
			await asyncio.sleep(self.__delay)
\end{python}

As seen above \verb|send_patch| calls the \verb|async def send_invocation| method, which communicates the vehicle's current information by invoking \newline
\verb|public async Task Patch| on \verb|VehiclesHub|.

The patch method on \verb|VehiclesHub| is responsible for handling the behavior, explicitly adjusting the velocity of individual vehicles:
\begin{csharp}
public partial class VehiclesHub : Hub
{
	...
	public async Task Patch(JsonDocument jsonDocument)
	{
		var vehicle = Vehicle.Create(jsonDocument);
		_database.Update(vehicle);
		vehicle = _database.Fetch(vehicle);
		...
	}
}
\end{csharp}
The snippet above shows that the method first creates a new vehicle using the information provided by the \verb|Client|. However, since this new vehicle does not contain all the information, such as the travel plan, the method first updates the existing vehicle in the database to refresh the vehicle with the available information. It then fetches the exact vehicle that was stored in the handshake, mentioned in \secref{handshake}. When the vehicle is successfully retrieved, it will then handle this vehicle accordingly:
\begin{csharp}
public partial class VehiclesHub : Hub
{
	...
	public async Task Patch(JsonDocument jsonDocument)
	{
		...
		await HandleIntersection(vehicle);
		await HandleInsideIntersection(vehicle);
		await HandleEndOfRoute(vehicle);
		...
	}
}
\end{csharp}
Shortly summarized \verb|HandleIntersection| is responsible for adjusting the velocity of every vehicle approaching the intersection to avoid collisions. Furthermore, \verb|HandleInsideIntersection| increases the speed to \verb|VehiclesHubDatabase| defined \verb|SpeedLimit|. Lastly, \verb|HandleEndOfRoute| ensures that any vehicle that has completed its journey, defined during the handshake, terminates its connection with the server.
