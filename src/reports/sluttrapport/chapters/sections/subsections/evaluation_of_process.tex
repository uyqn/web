\subsection{Self evaluation}

As mentioned earlier we used inspiration from two agile framworks: scrum and canban, but chose to lean more towards scrum in the end. We felt the use of scrum was helpful to reach our goals, however in hindsight we could have included our external supervisors more in the scrum process. We could have done this by including them in sprint retrospective meetings, and discussing together what our next sprint goals should have been.

We were able to satisfy most of the product goals and requirements in the end, however some extra hours were needed towards the end. Because of the time contsraint we found it difficult to focus on scalibility. We chose to mainly focus on getting a working demonstration of our IoT-system. In terms of scalibility, we can add more vehicles, but the roadmodel does not fully support functionalites for having more roads than we currently have in our demonstration. 

One challenge in the process was that our group were not able to meet as a whole as much as we had wished because of work. If we had worked more thoghout the process, the need for extra work in the end could have been prevented. In the MosCoW method (figure 3.1) we were able to finnish all the requirements in "must have" and "should have" section, but none of the "can have" section. All in all the group was satisfied with the process.
