\subsection{System security}
Security and privacy are important topics for any IoT system. Because these systems gather and work with vast amounts of data, they are naturally prone to be attacked. Moreover, as the systems grow and become more interconnected, with many devices worldwide, the imposed risk of such an attack increases drastically \parencite{iot_risk}. Anonymization of personal data, securing connections, and an intruder detection system are all security measures that require attention. The cars must be able to drive both with or without the system, which is an essential feature of system security. If there is a need for the server to shut down, the cars would need to be able to drive independently of the system.
