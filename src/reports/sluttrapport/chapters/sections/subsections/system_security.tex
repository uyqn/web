\subsection{System security}
Security and privacy are important topics for any IoT-system. Because these systems gather and work with huge amounts of data, they are naturally prone to being attacked. And as the systems grow and become more interconnected, with many devices around the world, the imposed risk of such an attack increases drastically [kilde p√• dette].

Therefore a lot of security measures needs to be implemented in the real world application such as anonymization of personal data, securing connections and a intruder detection system. As mentioned earlier, the cars can drive both with or without the system. This is an importaint feature in system security. That is because if there is a need for the server to shut down, the cars would need to be able to drive on their own as well.
