\subsection{Scalability}
When the knowledge and research has come further regarding AI, there may be a possibility for such an IoT system to be scaled for the real world. There is a need for less traffic in the cities and our results from this project shows that an IoT-system where cars can communicate through a server will increase traffic flow.

Our demo only contains two cars but our server is built in a way where multiple vehicles can connect to it. There are also possibilities to connect other devices to the server, for example traffic lights. However there are no specific functionalities regarding traffic lights on the server as of now. Scaling the IoT system for functionalities with traffic lights is a task for future development. Adding roads and making a more complex road system would also be a task for future development.
