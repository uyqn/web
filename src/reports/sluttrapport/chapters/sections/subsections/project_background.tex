\subsection{Project background}
Accenture has, over the years, offered final year students at OsloMet and Høyskolen i Kristiania innovative projects for their bachelor thesis. In 2020, a group of students from Høyskolen i Kristiania were developing model-sized self-driving vehicles using Raspberry Pi in conjunction with machine learning as their project. This year our group was offered to extend this project further; to explore plausible improvement with the addition of a centralized communication system.

Norway is one of the countries that are ready to utilize self-driving cars, according to Accenture. However, self-driving vehicles alone are likely not enough to solve all of today's traffic challenges. Hence, this project aims to solve the issue by introducing a management system for autonomous vehicles and evaluating the value such a system can provide.
