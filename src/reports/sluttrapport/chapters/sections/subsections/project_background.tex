\subsection{Project background}
For many years, Accenture has offered innovative bachelor thesis projects for students at OsloMet and Høyskolen Kristiania. In 2020, a group of students from Høyskolen Kristiania was developing model-sized self-driving vehicles using Raspberry Pi in conjunction with machine learning as their project. This year our group was offered to extend this project further; to explore plausible improvement with the addition of a centralized communication system.


According to x, a centralized communication system follows a client-server architecture, which means that multiple clients connect to a single server. When we mention client and server in our documentation, we reference the Raspberry Pi cars and our centralized server.

A centralized communication system follows a client/server architecture, where multiple clients connect to a server, and the server handles all the primary processing of data \parencite{centralized}. In this project, the Raspberry Pi vehicles act as a client that connects to a server that performs the major decisions for the vehicles. Thus, this report uses the terms; vehicles, and clients interchangeably, while the server refers to the centralized server.

According to our product owner, Norway is one of the countries that are ready to utilize self-driving cars. However, self-driving vehicles alone are likely not enough to solve all of today's traffic challenges. Hence, this project aims to solve the issue by introducing a management system for autonomous vehicles and evaluating the value such a system can provide.
