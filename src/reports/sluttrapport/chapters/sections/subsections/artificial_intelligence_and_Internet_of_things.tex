\subsection{Internet of Things}

The Internet Of Things refers to physical objects that communicate using sensors, cameras, software, or other technologies connecting and exchanging data. This communication takes place over the internet or other communication forms. The number of connected IoT devices in the world is increasing, and it is becoming a big part of society \parencite{iot_analytics}. IoT has also been evolving in recent years due to other technologies becoming more accessible, such as machine learning and the 5G network.

IoT projects can, for instance, be applied in climate surveillance systems, energy, or transportation. In this thesis we will explore the possibilities of using IoT in transportation, more specifically in personal automobiles. The convergence of these fields is more commonly known as IoV, Internet of Vehicles. An IoV system is a distributed system for wireless communication and information exchange between vehicles through agreed-upon communication protocols \parencite{chinese_iov}. The system could potentially integrate functionality for dynamic information exchange, vehicle control and smart traffic management. In our thesis, we will explore these possibilities on a small scale.
