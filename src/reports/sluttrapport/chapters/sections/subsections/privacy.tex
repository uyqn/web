\subsection{Privacy}
Throughout our work we discussed how the solution would look in the real world. If all drivers on a road were to connect their cars to the same server it would be easy for anyone with access to that server to track any one driver. Therefore we proposed a solution based on the concept of anonymity \textcolor{red}{(kilde på dette her, men vi må være på skolen for å ha tilgang)}. This is done by giving every vehicle that connects to the server an anonymous randomly generated identification-number that only lasts as long as the connection to the server is upheld. When the connection closes this number is deleted, and the same vehicle will get a new number the next time it connects to the server. This way we reduce the ability for an attacker to deduct any meaningful information tied to a single driver.
