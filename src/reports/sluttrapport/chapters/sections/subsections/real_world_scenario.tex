\subsection{Real world scenario}

If we compare the data from the semi physical demonstration to a real world cenario were instead of 80 cm/h the cars would drive in 80 km/h prior to an intersection. In the real world, one of the cars would have to stop before a traffic light while the other could drive past the intersection. This would lead to a velocity change from 80 km/h to 0. In our scenario the car would only have to slow down to 55 km/h.

However there are more factors to consider in a real world scenario such as: curved roads, human mistakes and animals jumping onto the road.
