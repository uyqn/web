\subsection{Real world scenario}
By comparing the semi-physical demonstration to a real-world scenario where instead of 80 cm/s, the cars would drive 80 km/h before an intersection. In the real world, one of the cars would have to stop before a traffic light while the other could drive past the intersection. Hence, it will involve some cars moving while other stops. In our scenario, the car would only have to slow down to 55 km/h.

Furthermore, our project does not consider other factors, such as curved roads, human mistakes, and animals jumping onto the road. Hence, our demonstrations, conducted in a controlled environment, are not a good reflection of a real-world scenario.
