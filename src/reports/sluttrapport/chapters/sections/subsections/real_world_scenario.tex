\subsection{Real world scenario}
 In the real world, one of the cars would have to stop before a traffic light while the other could drive past the intersection. Hence, it will involve some cars moving while others stop. In our scenario, the car would only have to slow down.

Furthermore, our project does not consider other factors, such as curved roads, human mistakes, and animals jumping onto the road. Hence, our demonstrations, conducted in a controlled environment, are not a good reflection of a real-world scenario.
