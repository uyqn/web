\subsection{Real world scenario}

We compared the data from the semi-physical demonstration to a real-world scenario where instead of 80 cm/h, the cars would drive at 80 km/h before an intersection. In the real world, one of the cars would have to stop before a traffic light while the other could drive past the intersection. That would lead to a velocity change from 80 km/h to 0. In our scenario, the car would only have to slow down to 55 km/h.

There are many factors to consider in a real-world scenario, such as curved roads, human mistakes, and animals jumping onto the road. Therefore the data extracted from the demonstrations can not perfectly correlate with a real-world scenario.
