\subsection{MoSCoW method}


MoSCoW method is a prioritization technique used in project managment to prioritize requirements. Since we were unsure how many use cases we finish within the time contraint of the priject period, we thought a prioritazion method was a good fit.  Under is the visualization of the MoSCoW method.

The "Mo" stands for must have ans is the number one priority requirements for our project. "S" stands for should have, the "Co" for could have, and "W" for will not have this time. The requirements in the "W" section is maybe for a later group if someone wants to further build on our project.
