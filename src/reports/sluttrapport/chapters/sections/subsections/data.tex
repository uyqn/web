\subsection{Data}
The data we can extract from this project comes from our semi-physical demonstration. We observed throughout multiple semi-physical demonstrations that even if the cars started at the same distance from an intersection and had the same initial velocity, they would be able to pass the intersection without having to stop. Stopping is unnecessary because of the server's intervention. An example of a successful demo is in figure 3.6. The server intervened by telling the car furthest from the intersection to slow down so that the other car could pass. The server's log showed that the car that slowed down before the intersection had changed its velocity from 80cm/s to 55 cm/s. The car had then returned to 80cm/s after the other car had passed the intersection.

A change in velocity can lead to a disruption of traffic flow. Therefore, we can conclude that in the specific scenario shown in the semi-physical demonstration, the server improved traffic flow.
