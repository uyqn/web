\subsection{Data}
The data we can extract from this projet comes from our semi physical demonstration. We observed thoughout multible semi physical demoes, that even if the cars startet at the same distance from an intersection and had the same initial velocity, they would be able to pass the intersection without having to stop. This is because prior to the intersection the server would tell the car that would enter the intersection last to slow down. An example of a successful demo kan be seen in figure 3.6. According to what the server was logging, the car that slowed down prior the the intersection had changed its velocity from 80cm/s so 55 cm/s. The car had then returned to 80cm/s after the other car had passed the intersection.

Change of velocity can lead to a distruption of traffic flow. We can  therefore conclude that in the specific scenario showed in the semi physical demonstration the server improved traffic flow.
