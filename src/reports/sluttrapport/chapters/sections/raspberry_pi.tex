\section{Raspberry Pi}
The core of the cars we used for our system was a Raspberry Pi board. These boards are esentially small computers that are popular in IoT-projects, because of the modularity they offer. Together with other components that work with these boards, we were able to solve our project. Learning how these components worked and how they interract with the Raspberry Pi computer was an important part of our solution.
