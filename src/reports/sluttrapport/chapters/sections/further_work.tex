\section{Further work}
How to implement self-driving in society in the best way is a question that will take a long time to answer. Through our work with this proof-of-concept we believe we have made an addition to this discussion. Due to time constraints, we have chosen not to implement some features that would make the product work in a more complex environment. These features could be explored if this project were to be further developed.
