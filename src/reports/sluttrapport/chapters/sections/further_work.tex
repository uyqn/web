%\subsection{Real world application}

The best way to implement self-driving cars in society is a topic that will take a long time to explore fully. Through our work with this proof-of-concept, we believe we have made an addition to this discussion. Due to time constraints, we have chosen not to create a system that will be viable for all scenarios. Such a system might still seem out of reach. However, individual contributions and new additions to this discussion might take us one step closer to a complete system.
