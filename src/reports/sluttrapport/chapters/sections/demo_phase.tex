\section{Phase 4 - Making a demo}

At this point in the development we were sure about what kind of situation we wanted to simulate to make a satisfying product for Accenture, and to answer the problem statement we had decided on. Following the work requirements we now needed to make a demonstration that showed how the system worked. At this point we also decided that we wanted to make a physical demonstration instead of making a digital simulation, although this was a solution that would take less effort and still be a valid solution. At the start of this work phase we had started to consider making only a digital simulation, but after a meeting with our external supervisors at Accenture, in which we were advised that a physical demonstration was more in line with Accenture's goals for the project, we finally decided to make a physical demonstration.
