\section{Phase 4 - Semi physical demonstration}
At this point in the development, we were sure about what kind of situation we wanted to simulate to make a satisfying product for Accenture and answer the problem statement in \secref{sec:problem_statement}. Following the work requirements, we still need to make a demonstration that showcases how the system works. Starting this work phase, the group and our internal supervisor strongly considered demonstrating our solution virtually. A virtual simulation could produce more data and consequently build a stronger case to answer our problem statement in \secref{sec:problem_statement}. Contrary, supervisors at Accenture convinced us that a demonstration utilizing the existing Raspberry Pi vehicle was more in line with Accenture's goals for the project. Hence, the group started to build a new Raspberry Pi vehicle for this purpose.
