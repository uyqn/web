\section{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}
Artificial intelligence(AI) leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind. At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving \parencite{artificial_intelligence}. There are two types of Ai, weak Ai and strong Ai. Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, is trained to perform specific tasks such as, voice recognition, data labeling, and in our case, driving cars. Narrow AI is the most common type of AI, and the type used in today's AI systems. 

Strong AI is made up of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) \parencite{artificial_intelligence}. General AI is a theoretical form of AI where a machine would have reached the same level of intelligence as a human being. Artificial Super intelligence is a theoretical form of AI where the machine has surpassed the intelligence of humans. This type of AI is often presented in movies.
