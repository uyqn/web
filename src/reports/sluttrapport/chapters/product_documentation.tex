\chapter{Program description}
The program is an IoT system where vehicles can communicate with a server. The server performs calculations to decide the behavior of the vehicles. The program's primary goal is to increase traffic flow and prevent traffic congestion. The system developed in this project has focused on incoming traffic at an intersection. \figref{fig:diagramserver} shows a flow diagram that describes the server in our demonstration, mentioned in \secref{sec:demo}.

Our solution adheres to the requirements Accenture set for us. As per discussed in \secref{sec:goals} the vehicles can also drive independently. Moreover, the server can establish multiple connections and determine the optimal speed of each vehicle depending on the incoming situation at an intersection. During the demonstration shown in \secref{sec:demo}, it became apparent that the outcome differs; when the cars were driving solely on the integrated AI in contrast to being connected to the server.
