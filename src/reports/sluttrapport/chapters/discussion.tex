\chapter{Discussion}

In addition to implementing the program, we also had discussions regarding the viability of the program. Here we will discuss our own process and how such and IoT-system would apply to the real world. We will use our own data as well as some research to reflect over the usability of an IoT system where self driving cars can communicate with eachother.
